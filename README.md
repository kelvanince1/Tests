# AdvancedNodeStarter
This repo is simply some Node features which will be useful to me at work.
Rather than re-write a lot of the same stuff, some of the boilerplate Node.js code I have created in this repo can be used to get started with.

Some of the work here includes:

* Redis for caching
* Clustering
* Testing with Jest (including some useful stuff like testing even after the user has authenticated)
